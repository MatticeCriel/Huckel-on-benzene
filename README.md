# Huckel-on-benzene
This is my first work in chemistry about correlation patterns in benzene.
This is done by using the Huckel model. Looking to changes of the pi-system when interactions are lowered and when we apply a chemical potential to one of the carbons. 
The result is that this approach can learn us something about the selectivity of a reaction in substituted pi-systems. Further we show that the mutual information a rising tool in quantum chemistry gives us the same insights.
