abstract = {This review focuses on the field of quantum entanglement applied to condensed matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial information can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated Rényi entropies are now well recognized to contain key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in detail. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.}

abstract  ="We examine in this contribution the possible relation between the spatial decay rate of real space delocalization measures and the insulating- or metallic-like character of molecular and extended systems. We first show that in simple one-electron models{,} like the Hückel or tight binding approximations{,} delocalization indices (DIs) are intimately linked to the first-order reduced density matrix (1RDM){,} whose decay rate is known to be exponential in gapped systems and algebraic in gapless ones. DIs are shown to behave equivalently{,} with wild oscillations in gapless 1D{,} 2D and 3D models that do only persist in one-dimensional real cases{,} as computed at the Hartree–Fock or Kohn–Sham levels. Oscillations are shown to be directly related to Pauling resonant structures and chemical mesomerism. DIs in insulating-like moieties decay extremely fast. We propose that examining the decay of DIs along different directions in real materials may be used to detect facile and non-facile conductivity channels."}
